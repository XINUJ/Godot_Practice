Simple practice exercise, no dependencies yet...

Week 1
![Test_Photo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94783231-a9dd-48e7-8996-5868ee937fc7)
Practice activity creating a "Hello World" statement with a moving node, in my case, it is a map with a character sprite.

New mechanics added such as projectiles and collision to the "Hello World" project.

We now started practicing creating runner games. In this activity I created a new project where I chose to replicate the chrome dinosaur runner game but with my own theme and flair.

The blobfish is quite the sad animal if brought to the surface since when taken away from its natural habitat on the ocean floor, it literally collapses (while dying painfully) on itself due to the changes in pressure, melting into a sad form. I like to imagine one escape from a scientific facility upon somehow gaining immortality and attempt to escape back at sea while fighting monsters (since it is a video game, why not?).

It somewhat has a difficulty system where higher levels bring new enemies. The game currently only has two levels where a higher level can be achieved by reaching a certain score (around 2000 the current version of the game). New enemies spawn (in this case, bats) upon reaching new levels.

Hitboxes might still need an update though as it is a bit unfair for the player.
